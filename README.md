# emojidictionary
A dictionary of emojis with corresponding R encoding to enable identification of emojis in mined social media data in R!
If you use this please cite and also mention Jessica Peterka-Bonetta
(see https://github.com/today-is-a-good-day/Emoticons/blob/master/emDict.csv and 
http://opiateforthemass.es/articles/emoticons-in-R/) <- this is where I got the idea from, but the list available here doesn't 
have ALL the emojis or skin tones so I made one of my own. I haven't updated it with the MOST recent one, but am working on
that at the moment.
